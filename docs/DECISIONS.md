# üé® Frontend Architecture Decisions

> **Key technical decisions for Capital Marketplace Frontend**

## üéØ **Core Frontend Stack**

### **1. Framework: Next.js 14 + App Router**
- **Decision:** Next.js 14 with App Router over Pages Router
- **Rationale:** React Server Components, improved performance, file-based routing, future-proof architecture
- **Tradeoff:** Learning curve vs. superior performance and developer experience
- **Future:** Leverage Server Components for advanced optimizations

### **2. Language: TypeScript Throughout**
- **Decision:** TypeScript for all components, utilities, and configurations
- **Rationale:** Type safety prevents runtime errors, better IDE support, easier refactoring
- **Tradeoff:** Build complexity vs. developer productivity and code reliability
- **Future:** Advanced type patterns and strict mode configuration

### **3. UI Library: Material-UI (MUI)**
- **Decision:** Material-UI over Chakra UI, Ant Design, or custom components
- **Rationale:** Comprehensive component library, TypeScript support, consistent design system
- **Tradeoff:** Bundle size vs. development speed and design consistency
- **Future:** Custom theme system and component extensions

## üîß **State Management & Forms**

### **4. Authentication: React Context + SessionStorage**
- **Decision:** React Context for auth state with sessionStorage token management
- **Rationale:** Simple implementation, automatic cleanup, no server-side sessions needed
- **Tradeoff:** Multi-tab limitations vs. MVP simplicity and security
- **Future:** JWT with refresh tokens for production scalability

### **5. Forms: React Hook Form + Zod**
- **Decision:** React Hook Form with Zod validation over Formik or native forms
- **Rationale:** Better performance, TypeScript integration, shared validation schemas
- **Tradeoff:** Learning curve vs. type safety and form performance
- **Future:** Advanced form patterns and dynamic validation

## üöÄ **Performance & Deployment**

### **6. Build: Next.js Standalone + Docker**
- **Decision:** Next.js standalone output with multi-stage Docker builds
- **Rationale:** Smaller images, faster deployment, self-contained application
- **Tradeoff:** Deployment flexibility vs. optimization and containerization benefits
- **Future:** Advanced Docker optimizations and CI/CD integration

## üìä **MVP Constraints & Future Roadmap**

| Component | MVP Implementation | Production Gap | Future Action |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Authentication** | SessionStorage | Multi-tab support | JWT + refresh tokens |
| **File Storage** | Local uploads | Scalability | Cloud storage integration |
| **State Management** | React Context | Complex state | Redux Toolkit/Zustand |
| **Testing** | Manual testing | Code coverage | Comprehensive test suite |
| **Real-time** | Polling | Live updates | WebSocket/SSE integration |
